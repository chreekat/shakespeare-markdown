## Friends, Romans, countrymen, render me your Markdown!

You know the drill.

## Marcus

Continuing the trend of names based on Shakespearean characters:

```haskell
[marcus|
# This will be converted to html!

With #{var} variable interpolation!

\#{x} <-- A backslash protects an interpolated variable from becoming a
header.
|]
```

----

Everything is pretty much what you would expect.
